          Motivation
      </p>
      <p>
        Life through the pleasure, passsion and purpose lens can have two totally different effects on your overall happiness depending on which way you are looking through it. If you are seeking happiness through pleasure the longivity of your happiness can not be guaranteed. Passion (flow ) and higher purpose gives us balanced happiness as we are enjoying every moment along the way. Destination is just a bonus rather than just living for the highs or successes.

        My core values I carry close to me are honesty and respect. Not only being honest and respectful towards others but to be the same with yourself. If you sugar coat things and are not honest with yourself on where you are going you are not respecting yourself. Although it is hard at times to know when to realise this, I believe if you have a gut feeling on something don't convice yourself of otherwise.

        Resilience is something I really need to work on, not just in coding but in day to day life. It's so easy just to give up on things when they get hard. Googling for the answer when you are stuck and know you havent given your best effort to solve it. I am trying to turn this around. The exercise was great and I feel it came at the right time this week. I have been quite overwhelmed by the amount of knowledge I feel I should have but feel I do not. No more negitivity and pessimissim. More optimisim!
