        Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity?
      </h5>
        <p>
            I really like the idea of workmanship and success of a team starting with trust. If you can not trust everyone in the team, they can not trust you. I haven't been able to put these techniques into practice yet but I plan to in the next week with more
            pair projects and bootcamp starting up. I will be working hard to become more empathic and be easy to trust.
        </p>
        <h5>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h5>
        <p>
            I will give this a go in my next conversation. I do find at times I may not come across empathic as I would like to. It's not that I'm not it's just how it comes across at times. With these techniques brought to my attention I will put them to good use!
        </p>

        <h5>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h5>
        <p>
            This was pretty cool as well! Thinking about a special person and the things you want for them is relaxing and gives you a good feeling. It motivates me to not let people down and give my honest effort at everything.

            <p>
                <em>1. Think of a difficult situation from your present or past, when there was some conflict or disagreement, something real, something that has some meaning and potency for you.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>2. Describe the situation as though you are 100 percent correct and reasonable.
                Do that either in writing or by talking about it in a monologue.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>3. Now describe the situation as though the other person is (or the other people are) 100 percent correct and reasonable. Do that either in writing or by talking about it in a monologue.</em>
