        <p>
          After reading chapter 7 of the Search Inside Yourself eBook I reflected on the following questions.
        </p>
        <h5>
        Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity?
      </h5>
        <p>
            I really like the idea of workmanship and success of a team starting with trust. If you can not trust everyone in the team, they can not trust you. I haven't been able to put these techniques into practice yet but I plan to in the next week with more
            pair projects and bootcamp starting up. I will be working hard to become more empathic and be easy to trust.
        </p>
        <h5>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h5>
        <p>
            I will give this a go in my next conversation. I do find at times I may not come across empathic as I would like to. It's not that I'm not it's just how it comes across at times. With these techniques brought to my attention I will put them to good use!
        </p>

        <h5>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h5>
        <p>
            This was pretty cool as well! Thinking about a special person and the things you want for them is relaxing and gives you a good feeling. It motivates me to not let people down and give my best effort at everything.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h5>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h5>
            <p>
                <em>1. Think of a difficult situation from your present or past, when there was some conflict or disagreement, something real, something that has some meaning and potency for you.</em> </br></br> Last week I was driving up to a intersection. I was in the straight lane, my light was green and the traffic turning right were on a red light. I continued through past the stopped turning traffic when a car in the turning lane at the last minute indicated and tried to turn into my lane while I was going through at 50km/h. I had to slam on my brakes and sounded my horn as the move he was making was dangerous! He then pulled in close behind me and was giving me the finger. Bit of a interesting character.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>2. Describe the situation as though you are 100 percent correct and reasonable.</em></br></br>If it wasn't for my quick thinking and alertness while driving we would have most likely had a full on crash. The driver was expecting traffic to stop for him as he obviously made the wrong decision on where he was going. For him to then follow me closely and be mad at me sounding my horn and not being able to let him in front of me is a bit over the top.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>3. Now describe the situation as though the other person is (or the other people are) 100 percent correct and reasonable.</em></br></br>The other driver may have thought no one was coming. Possibily already stressed from getting in the wrong lane he made a turn which he thought was safe. All of a sudden I'm there sounding my horn and going past him. He could have thought I had come from behind him and cut him off in the similar way he did to me which made him angry as it was a near crash for him.
