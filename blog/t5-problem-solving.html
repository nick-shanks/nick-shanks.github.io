          Problem Solving
      </p>
      <p>
        Damn JavaScript, back at it again with the blocks! JS can really test you as a stable minded human being! Whether it be a simple problem fix, or a big problem, it's hard to know how close you are to having the correct code. But this week has been good and the more time I spend looking at the JS code the more comfortable I feel. I should just look at it 24/7, right?
    </p>
    <p>
        This week I had a couple blocks, one being a pretty simple problem in that I had a syntax error when trying to access a property that was first in an array. I used a couple techniques to try and solve this problem by googling, then eventually reaching out to peers in my cohort as I could not finding the right way to call it. I felt pretty good during this process as I knew all I needed to do was find out how to call it as there were two properties in that array and we only wanted to modify the first one in the DOM. Andrew ended up finding the right syntax by googling, he passed the link on to me (thank you!) in which I corrected my syntax and broke out of the block.
    </p>
    <p>
        From that block experience I learned that if it is a syntax error I should google a bit longer and read deeper as the answer is usually there right in front of you, sometimes you just need to have a proper look. I should do the same for my keys and sunglasses too!
    </p>
    <p>
        Even though I only used two for that block there are many more problem solving techniques that are good to use when you are blocked or just generally trying to solve a problem.
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong>Pseudocode:</strong> I'm feeling semi-confident using Pseudocode. When doing the assingments this week the step-by-step process that we were supposed to do to output a code was written pretty well and I feel I understood what was being asked of us, but found in tough in later assignments to put it into code. I think it was mostly just not knowing correct syntax so hoping that'll come right later with more us of JS.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Trying something:</strong>  I'm pretty good at trying to write the code. I usually have a pretty good feel of what is needed, it's just getting it correct which is proving a different beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong> I haven't yet tried this method but I usually talk to myself, so talking to an inanimate object isn't far from my realm of craziness.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Reading error messages:</strong> To be honest I'm not too good at reading error messages in the terminal. It's quite overwhelming seeing all that code come up but is definantly something that I should not shy away from. In Codeacdemy I'm not bad with their error messages as it gives you a few different options as to what the error my be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Console.logging:</strong> I haven't really used console.log this week in our assignments but again is something I should use. Especially when trying to call array properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Googling:</strong> I do Google quite a bit when I'm blocked but I find myself just skim reading at times. If I read properly I may find the answer I am looking for faster. With that being said I have become unblocked quite a few times just by using Google so that surely means I'm not terrible at it!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong> Now this I am good at! Maybe too good.. Sometimes it feels like I'm the only one who gets blocked by looking at our slack history, but that's OK. Like I said earlier, if I used Google and the other techniques better I may not need to ask on our Slack group so much. Sometimes it feels like the easy way out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Asking your coaches for help:</strong> See above!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Improving your process with reflection:</strong> I am pretty decent at reflecting back on the block I just had and what I could have done better or what I did well. As I said above I do need to apply myself better when intially becoming blocked, which means trying harder to find the issues myself or looking through my notes as the answer is most likely in there. I feel I am becoming better with my mindset when I am blocked as I know there is always an answer to the issue and it isn't far away!

    <h4>Arrays</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Array.prototype.map(  ):</strong> takes a selected array and makes a new array with a set of things you want to perform on the original. The array you used the map on stays the same and a new one is made.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Array.prototype.filter(  ):</strong> basically doesn't let things into an array that do not met set requirements to be inside the array. e.g if only strings are allowed inside the array there will no numbers inside when the new array is logged out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Array.prototype.reduce(  ):</strong> takes a set of things that is applied to it and returns a single value instead of the whole array which may have 2 or more values.
