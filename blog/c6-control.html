        One of my triggers is not knowing where to begin when reading a code task. If I have no idea where to begin this usually sets me off. I feel this does this because I already feel like I am a bit behind where I need to be, so when I have no idea where to begin I think back to how I feel I need to know more. If I just settled down and looked into what needed to be done a bit more I would find that the solution is far away if I just have a good mindset.

        The Seberian North Railroad Exercise (stop, breathe, notice, reflect, respond) was pretty good and makes a lot of sense. It forces you not to act and to calmly think about what is going on. By slowing down the fast paced trigger when the room feels like it's spinning or you are out of control in a tunnel going 150km/ph, it brings you back to reality where you can make decisions with a clear unclouded mindstate.
