            Leadership
        </p>
        <h5>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h5>
        <p>
          In the sports realm I have had a few. Coaches who really want to see you succeed, for you, rather than themselves. It is definitely motivating to have someone who understands were you are and what you are going though to then point you in the right direction. It gives you confidence that there is someone there with you along the journey, whatever it might be.
        </p>
         <h5>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h5>
         <p>
           This is another good meditating exercise. Thinking positively like this gives me good feels. Whenever I'm feeling stressed or worried I'll come to this and use it. I'm really enjoying these meditation techniques, it's something I have never done before!
         </p>
         <h5>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h5>
         <p>
           This one was a bit harder and didn't have as nicer feelings during it but after it was better. Kind of like doing exercise. It's hard during it but after you don't regret it!
         </p>
         <h5>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h5>

        <p>
          I think it applies pretty well, I'll go through each and try to relate them to Phase 0 and how I'll apply them in bootcamp!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Status:</strong> This is really important to me. I'm not fussed in the aspect of how I'm perceived by others, but I am very tough on myself. If I'm not improving at something in life I do not feel satisfied at all, or happy. Sometimes I just wish I could be happy with where I am as it sometimes feels like chasing the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow but it's also good in the fact that I'm always improving (well, trying). In Phase 0 it's been good in the fact that I'm always trying to better my work from last week, or yesterday. I will carry this on into bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Certainty:</strong> I'm bad with this! I always worry about if doing things will result in something bad happening. Uncertainty on whether code is for me, quitting my job was worth it. I'm going to try my best not to carry this in to bootcamp! Mindfullness will help.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Autonomy:</strong> I feel over Phase 0 my autonomy has been OK. I need to get in control of my environment better and not give energy to stress. Going into bootcamp I'm not sure how it will go as I'm not sure what to expect or what the levels of stress will be. But I'll soon find out!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Relatedness:</strong> I've gone into Phase 0 and will go into bootcamp with the same mindset that I want to get to know everyone. I'll be open and try to relate with all from the start.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fairness:</strong> Haha the example in the book for this was pretty funny. But accepting everything that is presented to you is obviously the selfless thing to do. I think I have been pretty good at this in Phase 0. In terms of being happy with the help I have been given, and will look to do the same in bootcamp.
