          Emotional Intelligence
      </p>
      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence is the ability to monitor ones own and others feelings and emotions. The ability to discern amoung those and to use this information to guide ones thinking and actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are five interrelated domains;
      </p>
        <ul class="emotionallist">
          <li class="emolist">Self-awareness</li>
          <li class="emolist">Self-regulation</li>
          <li class="emolist">Motivation</li>
          <li class="emolist">Empathy</li>
          <li class="emolist">Social skills</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          They are broken into two further domains with self-awareness, self-regulation and motivation being <strong>intrapersonal</strong> and empathy and social skills being <strong>interpersonal</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Being in control of and having understanding of these domains will have benefits including stellar work performance, outstanding leadership and the ability to create the conditions for happiness. To be in control of these you almost can step back from any situation and know how to react without getting caught up in the moment. For myself, I can relate to this and need to work to improve all 5 of my domains.
