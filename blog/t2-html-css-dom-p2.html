       <p>Our eyes naturally follow patterns when we look at things. We usually start in the top left, then we'll look from left to right and then top to bottom. Traditional print based media takes advantage of the way our eyes follow and so do websites! Usually you will have the title at the top because thats the first thing you want the reader/user to see when they open the page. After they read the title they will look left and usually you will have images, images are there to capture attention because people look at images first. They'll then go left to the heading and then down below to the text or paragraph. This type of design is what we call a grid based layout and many, if not all, websites follow a grid based layout.</p>
       
       <p>People use many different types of devices to access the internet. From PC's and laptops to tablets and phones. In fact, more and more every year people are accessing the intenet primarly though their phones or tablets! Following the rules of responsive design, means that your page isn't fixed to a single size. It doesn't matter the device the user is using, the page is going to respond and look great. </p>

       <p>Once you have figured out the structure of your HTML you can start to think about semantic tags. These are tags that make sense to the browser and to any humans looking at them. These include h tags, p tags, div classes. For instance h1 tags tell you that the header is the most important on the page, h2 important, h3 less important and so on. It's important to ask if any text needs to stand out and then add the appropriate semantic tags to style it appropriately. </p>

       <p>Place holder images are a good idea! These can be put into places that a image will go in the future and may not be avaliable to you right now. Place-hold websites have images you can add and have the exact height and width of what you need to fill that place. Check them out if you need this for your website!</p>
