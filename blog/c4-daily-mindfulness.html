        This blog couldn't come at a better time. Last week was full on and having this chapter to go through has been great. One of the three self-awareness competencies I will look to use and improve is my self-confidence. I feel this is a factor in which I do not perform to my best at times. If I have more confidence in my capibilties of learning I will have a better overall self awareness. In turn I will give off better energy to those around me.

        I liked the insula workout. Coincidentally, I did a section on <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">HeadSpace</a> today that worked on the insula too. It was quite interesting to feel your body inside your mind and go to parts of the body that are more tense and feel that area. I didn't realise this was working my insula at the time but after watching this video I now know this can directly improve your emotional awareness if you build up your insula.
