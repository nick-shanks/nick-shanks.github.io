    <h3>Which timebox and habits did you try?</h3>
      <p>
      I am giving the Pomodoro Techinque a go while doing this blog. I have always had issues with being easily distracted by outside sources while doing work. I am hoping this will keep me focussed on the task at hand.
      </p>
    <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
      <p> 
      In the past I have used meditation, in particular moving meditation, while swimming. Diving deeper into the other realms of meditation looks interesting. I tried to not get caught in a rabbit hole while looking through this info but the concept of daily mindfulness meditation looks cool also. 
      </p>
    <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
      <p>The Pomodoro Technique is working well so far! I still have 20 minutes left!!</p>

    <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
      <p>Pomodoro technique and Mindfullness Meditation stuck out to me the most but I am also keen to try out the Fogg Method.</p>
