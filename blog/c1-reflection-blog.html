      <p id="title">
      A reflection on <a class="linkblogtitle" href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef's Fireside Chat
      </a>
      </p>
      <h4>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h4>
      <p>
        My take on what Shereef explained about DBC/EDA is it will be a rollercoaster of learning about yourself and others just as much as it will be about learning code. The experience is going to be what you make of it <em>yourself</em>, not how others are going to make for you. For myself this will be great and like Shereef said, is something most of us need to work on. I know I need to!
      </p>
      <h4>What are your impressions?</h4>
      <p>
        From this chat, my immediate impression is do not go in with a restaurant mindset! Most of us go in to things we have paid for and expect a service, Shereef used some great examples that made it easy to understand. It's not just that simple. Everything is what <em>you</em> make of it.
      </p>
      <h4>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h4>
      <p>
        I see myself fitting in to this culture well. I am excited to meet new people and work with in a team who is learning and going through the same day to day experiences. I am keen to motivate the next person as much as I am wanting to push and motivate myself.
      </p>

      <h4>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h4>
      <p>
        Definitely more inspired. I was put on to the EDA course by a friend who explained how everything worked, so I did have an idea of what to expect in this regard. I had also done the reading on Engineering Empathy prior to the video but it was great to hear it from a Founding Father to give it that extra importance.
      </p>

      <h4>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h4>
      <p>
        Am I excited? For sure. In the past I have worked for companies where everyone just stuck to themselves and it does not create a fun and inspiring working/learning enviroment. A place where everyone pushes each other to be the best version of themselves excites me. Am I nervous? For sure. But if I wasn't nervous, I don't think it wouldn't mean as much to me.
