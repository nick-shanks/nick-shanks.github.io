    <h3>Below is a reflection on <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef's Fireside Chat</a></h3>
    <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
      <p>My take on what Shereef explained about DBC/EDA is it will be a rollercoaster of learning about yourself and others just as much as it will be about learning code. The experience is going to be what you make of it <em>yourself</em>, not how others are going to make for you. For myself this will be great and like Shereef said, is something most of us need to work on. I know I need to!
      </p>
    <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
      <p>From this chat, my immediate impression is do not go in with a restaurant mindset! Most of us go in to things we have paid for and expect a service, Shereef used some great examples that made it easy to understand. It's not just that simple. Everything is what <em>you</em> make of it. 
      </p>
    <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
      <p>I see myself fitting in to this culture well. I am excited to meet new people and work with in a team who is learning and going through the same day to day experiences. I am keen to motivate the next person as much as I am wanting to push and motivate myself.</p>

    <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
      <p>Definitely more inspired. I was put on to the EDA course by a friend who explained how everything worked, so I did have an idea of what to expect in this regard. I had also done the reading on Engineering Empathy prior to the video but it was great to hear it from a Founding Father to give it that extra importance.</p>

     <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
      <p>Am I excited? For sure. In the past I have worked for companies where everyone just stuck to themselves and it does not create a fun and inspiring working/learning enviroment. A place where everyone pushes each other to be the best version of themselves excites me. Am I nervous? For sure. But if I wasn't nervous, I don't think it wouldn't mean as much to me. </p>
