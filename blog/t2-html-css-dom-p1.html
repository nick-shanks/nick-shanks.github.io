        What is HTML, CSS and the DOM? Part.1
      </p> 
       <p>
        How's everyone going? I know you are all thinking, what on earth is HTML, CSS and DOM? So, I'm going to try to explain as easy as I can. HTML is what puts structure to a webpage. Think of it as the same as how a tree truck puts structure to a tree. The more of it, the bigger the tree is. The more HTML the more a webpage will be. Pretty simple right?
      </p>
      <p>
        OK, on to CSS. Think of CSS as the leaves on a tree. Leaves cover the trunk and makes it look good. You can use CSS to make a webpage look as beautiful as you want! Different fonts and colours can be added to make a page stand out. The more colourful leaves on a tree the more beautiful it looks!
      </p>
      <p>
        The DOM (Document Object Model) is like the tree's branches. The DOM categorises sections inside a HTML and let's each section have it's own branch, the more sections within a section, the more branches off the main branch. Kind of like a family tree!

        Boxifying a design a tool a web developer can use when given a mock design and told to turn it into a webpage. You take the design and draw boxes around all the different parts you see on the mock e.g around the top header, the image inside the header, around the body and the text inside the body. This makes it easy to know how many different sections you will need to create when turning the design in to a web page.
      </p>
      <p>
        The box model is inside Dev Tools and when a section is highlighted will tell you how much margin, border, padding and content that section currently has.
