          JavaScript Basics
      </p>
      <p>
        Another week another langauge and this one takes the cake. Attemping to learn JavaScript has definitley owned me! There have been many ups and downs, many blocks and more blocks. Still a lot of work to do!!
      </p>
      <p>
        On to the nitty gritty. Javascript doesn't really compare with HTML and CSS. Totally different ball park and it feels like hard-core code. Matrix code. JavaScript is a programming language while HTML and CSS are merely scripting languages, which is weird with JavaScript having 'script' in it. There isn't room for forgiveness in JavaScript. What you are coding has to be correct. Exactly correct. There are different ways you can do one thing but the way in which you do it has to be right. HTML is much more forgiving in terms of missing items as it will add it for you if it's a simple fix. JavaScript. Nope. Attention to detail is key!
      </p>
      <p>
        Control flow in JavaScript allows your code to take certain actions based on a variety of scenarios. If something is true it will give a certain action, if it is false it will give a different action. For example say you lied to your mother compared to telling the truth and she found out. Each of these outcomes will be different! There are different statements you can use for different scenarios. If there is a simple true or false answer you would you an if/else statement. If there are a lot of different outcomes, like in a game of basketball, you would use 'switch' statements to make it easier instead of writing out a lot of code. When you want to do an action a number of times until an outcome is reached, you could simply write it, but this is tedious and impractical. For loops allows you to run a piece of code as many times as you want without repeating yourself. While loops will keep running a code until a condition is met, which you determine yourself. Loops are like washing machines. You could wash your clothes by hand (write it out) or you could use a washing machine (loop). Washing clothes by hand follows a certain flow. First you dip it in water, then you soap it, then you scrub it , repeat this process 3 times, then the clothes are clean. You could use a for loop for this in that the loop of dip, soap then scrub is repeated 3 times as you already know that this process needs to be repeated 3 times for the clothes to be clean. In this case, a for loop is like a washing machine!

        Accessing data from arrays and objects are slightly different. Because items inside arrays are held inside boxes, you access them using [ ] notation and then what position they are inside the array beginning from 0. When accessing in objects you use the dot notation, but if you are needing access a string you could use bracket notation. All you need to write is the object name and then the key name.
      </p>

      <p>
      A function takes in inputs, does something with them and produces an output. This is great as it saves that code inside the function and saves you having to write it out everytime. Instead of making small changes to the same thing and typing it out again you could probably be using a function. D.R.Y! (Don't Repeat Yourself!).
