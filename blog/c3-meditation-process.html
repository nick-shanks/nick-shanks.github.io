      Meditation Process
    </p>
    <p>
      Process over product is something I need to work on. I get caught up in wanting things to look good from the beginning which just isn't the best way to work, the process is more important. A finished product is what matters most so using too much time on how things look during the process is not good. Add it to the list it!

      Before watching the second Search Inside Yourself video I thought of meditiation as something to do to make yourself relaxed. After watching this video I learnt that happiness is always with you, it's not something you pursue, it's there inside you but is just clouded by other things. Meditation clears the clouds of worry, stress and clutteredness and takes you back to your defaut state of mind. Which is happiness.

      I learnt that there is a term for when your mind drifts away from concentration and you realise this, it is called <em>meta-attention</em>. Meta-attention is one of the secrets to concentration. If you realise you have drifted out of attention you can train your brain to better concentrate, almost strengthening your concentration like someone does when doing curls in the gym to strengthen their biceps. This technique stood out to me as I do realise a lot when my concentration drifts and I always feel bad this happens, when really it is normal. The part that matters is that you pull your mind back into attention. Doing this when meditating will strengthen your skills to do this in everyday activites or work.

      Another technique I want to try and need to work on improving is not automaticly responding to simulis or outside distractions, e.g a itch, your phone buzzing, thinking of an issue. If you don't react to this straight away your have control of your mindfullness. Give yourself 4-5 breaths before reacting and you will be in control.
